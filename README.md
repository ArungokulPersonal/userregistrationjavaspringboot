User Registration Module By Java Spring Boot

This module is built using Java Spring Boot to handle user registration, including functionality for creating, validating, and managing user accounts. It provides a REST API for user registration and supports features such as password validation, email verification, and error handling.

Features
User Registration: Allows users to sign up with a unique username, password, and email.
Password Validation: Ensures the password meets security criteria (e.g., length, special characters).
Error Handling: Provides descriptive error messages for invalid input or unsuccessful registration.
CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user accounts.
Technologies
Java: Version 8 or later
Spring Boot: Version 2.7+
Spring Security: For authentication and password management
PostgreSQL: For database management (can be replaced with any other database)
Spring Data JPA: For database interaction
Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code
Maven: For dependency management
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Java (JDK 8 or later)
Maven (for building the project)
PostgreSQL (or other database if configured differently)
Postman (optional, for testing the API endpoints)
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ArungokulPersonal/userregistrationjavaspringboot.git
cd userregistrationjavaspringboot
2. Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database with the name user_db (or any preferred name) and configure the connection details in application.properties. For formatting purposes in this project I've used YML for application rather than using properties, but we can use both.

properties
Copy code
# src/main/resources/application.yml
server:
  error:
    include-message: always
    include-binding-errors: always

spring:
  datasource:
    password: admin@123
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/registration
    username: postgres
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    properties:
      hibernate:
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        format_sql: true
    show-sql: true
3. Run the Application
Compile and run the application using Maven.

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
